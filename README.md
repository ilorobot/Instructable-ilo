# Instructable for ILO

ILO is an educational robot it will allow you to test on the real world your code. This instructable is here to help you assemble is robot with omnidirectional wheels. You can also have access to the code for the different parts, the arduino, the ESP32 and for the mobile app. The STL files are available for those who wish to 3D print the robot. Finally you have access to the Unified Robot Description File (urdf) and a launch file to use ILO in gazebo with ROS. Enjoy ;)

# Overview 

This section should give a good understanding of the project and to which extend you can use it for your personal applicaiton.

## Why an educational robot

Programming could be a very complicated task when you start. When you are learning it either by yourself or at school you might not really enjoy it at first. The reason is mostly because it is to abstact. ILO helps you testing your ligns of code and enjoy a real life application to them, making the learning of coding more fun...
